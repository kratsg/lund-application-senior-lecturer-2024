\subsection{Research environment and scholarly networks}\label{ssec:research-environment-and-scholarly-networks}

A detailed breakdown of key research projects that I am involved in, as well as their scholarly networks are summarized in~\Cref{ssec:important-research-collaborations}. I am a member of the ATLAS Collaboration, based at CERN. Within ATLAS, I have worked in:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
	\item Physics Analysis Working Groups: Supersymmetry, Exotics, Higgs, and Standard Model
	\item Combined Performance Working Groups: Jet/MET
	\item Other Working Groups: Analysis Model Group, Statistics Committee, and Computing \& Software
	\item Upgrade Efforts: Level-1 Calorimeter Phase I, Inner Tracker Phase II
\end{itemize}

Outside of the ATLAS Collaboration, I have expressed interest and put some work towards other experiments in my free time:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
	\item Belle-II: initially providing statistics support through \texttt{pyhf}, but I would like to explore \enquote{light} dark matter candidates
	\item IRIS-HEP: supporting the implementation of analysis facilities that will enable the work of many physicists in the future for the HL-LHC era
	\item SciKit-HEP: collaborating with many members on the open-sourced software and computing efforts to positively impact the experience of physics analyzers
	\item HEP Software Foundation: developed training materials (\Cref{chap:teaching-qualifications-portfolio}) to improve software literacy in HEP
	\item Other future facilities: muon collider and FCC; initially focused on developing the software infrastructure to reduce the barrier to entry for other physicists
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supervision experience}\label{ssec:supervision-experience}
\subsubsection{Experience as a principal supervisor \noneyet}\label{sssec:experience-as-a-principal-supervisor-noneyet}
% name, year of degree, higher education institution, thesis title, assistant supervisor if applicable. Indicate the doctoral student’s current work/position}
\subsubsection{Experience as an assistant supervisor}\label{sssec:experience-as-an-assistant-supervisor}
% name, year of degree, higher education institution, thesis title, name of principal supervisor}

During my postdoc tenure at UC Santa Cruz and my studies at UChicago, I mentored graduate students across various analysis and hardware projects. I list undergraduate students that I mentored in~\Cref{ssec:supervision-at-the-bachelor-s-and-master-s-degree-levels}.

			\setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
			\item Excellent research and/or creative activity, showing strong evidence of research/creative innovation and productivity (e.g., scholarly distinctions, publications, presentations, inventions, exhibits, performances, products), as well as the nominee’s research/creative innovation and productivity having a significant or potentially significant impact on the field and/or society more broadly
			\item Leadership and/or strong service (e.g., preparing manuscripts, funding applications, organizing workshops or conferences, volunteering in professional and/or other organizations, etc.)
			\item Effective mentorship by advising graduate students, undergraduate students, and/or any other group in a professional setting
			\item Support and fostering of equity, diversity, and inclusion within their research group, department, institution, community, and/or field through their research/creativity, mentoring/teaching, and/or service activities
		\end{itemize}} [Citation from UC Santa Cruz]}
\Award{Springer Thesis Award}{Aug 2019}{\enquote{The series \enquote{Springer Theses} brings together a selection of the very best Ph.D. theses from around the world and across the physical sciences. Nominated and endorsed by two recognized specialists, each published volume has been selected for its scientific excellence and the high impact of its contents for the pertinent field of research. For greater accessibility to non-specialists, the published versions include an extended introduction, as well as a foreword by the student’s supervisor explaining the special relevance of the work for the field. As a whole, the series will provide a valuable resource both for newcomers to the research fields described, and for other scientists seeking detailed background information on special questions. Finally, it provides an accredited documentation of the valuable contributions made by today’s younger generation of scientists.} [Citation from Springer]}
\Award{Nathan Sugarman Award for Excellence in Graduate Student Research}{May 2017}{\enquote{For his technical contributions and creative insights in the design and prototyping of a new high-speed electronics trigger system for Lorentz-boosted massive particles for the ATLAS Experiment.} [Citation from University of Chicago]}
\Award{US ATLAS Outstanding Graduate Student Award}{Jun 2016}{\enquote{In recognition of your exceptionally broad and noteworthy contributions to the ATLAS experiment. In particular, we recognize your critical contributions to the electronics design and prototyping for a new high-speed trigger electronics system for the Phase 1 upgrade, software development, leadership in the creation of a new method to search for Supersymmetry, and software education.} [Citation from US ATLAS]}
\Award{Young Researchers’ Symposium Award for Best Poster Presentation}{Nov 2015}{This was awarded for the best poster presentation of on-going research at Brookhaven National Lab, sponsored by the American Physical Society. The poster focused on the research I was doing as part of the US DOE SCGSR fellowship described below.}
\Award{U.S. DOE, Oﬀice of Science Graduate Student Research Fellowship}{Oct 2015}{This was given for the project titled \enquote{Boosted object hardware trigger development and testing for the Phase I upgrade of the ATLAS Experiment at Brookhaven National Lab} in collaboration with BNL Omega Group leader Dr. Michael Begel. The goal of the award is to enable early career scientists to be relocated temporarily at a national lab, creating a pathway to advance Ph.D. thesis research while using state-of-the-art facilities and cutting-edge scientific instrumentation. There is the added benefit of being able to expand my professional network and develop more opportunities for my future in HEP.}
\Award{US LHC Users Association Lightning Round winner}{Nov 2014}{Early career scientists are invited to give rapid-fire presentations on their Ph.D. research. A select few who win this \enquote{lightning round} of talks are then invited to join other scientists and colleagues in Washington D.C. on a policy-advocacy trip to communicate the importance of funding HEP research. Direct communication with U.S. Congress is critical to explain the current status of HEP projects, and inform our representatives about the impact that funding our research has in the U.S. and globally.}
