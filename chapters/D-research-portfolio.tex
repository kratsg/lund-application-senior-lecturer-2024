\section{Research experience and qualifications} \label{sec:research-experience-and-qualifications}

\subsection{Research environment and scholarly networks}\label{ssec:research-environment-and-scholarly-networks}

A detailed breakdown of key research projects that I am involved in, as well as their scholarly networks are summarized in~\Cref{ssec:important-research-collaborations}.

I am a member of the ATLAS Collaboration, based at CERN. Within ATLAS, I have worked in:

\begin{itemize}
	\setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
	\item Physics Analysis Working Groups: Supersymmetry, Exotics, Higgs, and Standard Model
	\item Combined Performance Working Groups: Jet/MET
	\item Other Working Groups: Analysis Model Group, Statistics Committee, and Computing \& Software
	\item Upgrade Efforts: Level-1 Calorimeter Phase I, Inner Tracker Phase II
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Supervision experience}\label{ssec:supervision-experience}
\subsubsection{Experience as a principal supervisor \noneyet}\label{sssec:experience-as-a-principal-supervisor-noneyet}
% name, year of degree, higher education institution, thesis title, assistant supervisor if applicable. Indicate the doctoral student’s current work/position}
\subsubsection{Experience as an assistant supervisor}\label{sssec:experience-as-an-assistant-supervisor}
% name, year of degree, higher education institution, thesis title, name of principal supervisor}

During my postdoc tenure at UC Santa Cruz and my studies at UChicago, I mentored graduate students across various analysis and hardware projects. I list undergraduate students that I mentored in~\Cref{ssec:experience-as-an-assistant-supervisor-undergrad}.
